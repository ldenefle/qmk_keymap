# Lulu's Keebs fw

This repository contains the source files to generate the firmwares for my three keyboards:
+ `wooden`: my first keyboard, a gh60 satan version, clicky with a portable bamboo case
+ `multicolor`: my second keyboard, dz60 based with a case with integrated wristrest
+ `lucii`: bequest of my good friend [Lucas Da Costa](https://lucasfcosta.com/), it's an all-white dz60

# Repository structure

The firmwares are based on the ubiquiitous [QMK Firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware). It's aimed
to be structured as an userspace compilation database for QMK, which gives me great flexibility on the features I can used while
not have to install a compilation environment on my machine. 

The firmwares are built on the Github CI and exist as artifact of Actions and Releases.
